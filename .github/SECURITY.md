# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

It is recommended that you use the stable branch as it's tested and used by most. The dev branch may contain bleeding-edge commits that are not well tested and are not meant to be used in production environments.<br>
Version tags lower than the [latest stable release](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/macutil/releases/latest) are **not** supported.
